# Seattle Tide Graph

I just wanted a simple way to see tide information for where I like to paddle.

This example is hard-coded to Meadow Point (near Golden Gardens) but you can get your own widget code from [here](https://www.tidegraph.com/index.php?page=339264.txt&src=//tides.tidegraph.com/api/tidegraph.php?bg%3Dwhite%26scale%3D1%26color%3Dblack%26lat%3D47.6733790%26lng%3D-122.4076660&background_option=white-black&scale=1&station_option=latlng_station&lat=47.6733790&lng=-122.4076660).
